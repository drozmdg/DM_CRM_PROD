## üìã Required User Actions for Production Deployment

### **IMMEDIATE TASKS (Critical for Production)**

#### **1. Database Migration Execution** üî•
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time:** 15-30 minutes  

**Steps:**
1. **Backup Current Database**
   ```bash
   # Create a backup before migration
   pg_dump --host=your-supabase-host --username=postgres --dbname=postgres > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   ```

2. **Execute Authentication Schema Migration**
   ```bash
   # Apply the authentication schema
   psql --host=your-supabase-host --username=postgres --dbname=postgres -f authentication_schema_migration.sql
   ```

3. **Verify Migration Success**
   - Check that user tables are created
   - Verify RLS policies are active
   - Test database connectivity

#### **2. Environment Configuration** üî•
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time:** 10-15 minutes  

**Production Environment Variables:**
Create/Update your production `.env` file:
```bash
# Production Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your-production-supabase-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-production-access-token

# Security Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-min-32-chars
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:**
- Generate strong, unique secrets for JWT_SECRET and SESSION_SECRET
- Use production Supabase credentials (not development)
- Whitelist only your production domains in ALLOWED_ORIGINS

#### **3. SSL Certificate Setup** üî•
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time:** 30-60 minutes  

**Action Required:**
- Configure HTTPS/SSL for your production domain
- Update CORS origins to use HTTPS URLs
- Verify SSL certificate is valid and trusted

#### **4. Create First Admin User** ‚ö°
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes  

**Steps:**
1. Start your production server
2. Navigate to the registration page
3. Create your first user account
4. **Manually update the user role in database:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET role = 'Admin' WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@company.com';
   ```

- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] XSS protection blocks malicious input
- [ ] SQL injection attempts fail safely
- [ ] Unauthorized API access returns 401/403
- [ ] Session security (no token leakage in browser)
