/**
 * Migration Utility for DM_CRM
 *
 * This utility helps migrate data from localStorage to the hosted Supabase instance.
 * It provides functions for exporting data from localStorage, transforming it to match
 * the Supabase schema, and importing it into Supabase.
 *
 * NOTE: This file is deprecated and has been refactored into the src/lib/migration directory.
 * It is kept for backward compatibility and will be removed in a future update.
