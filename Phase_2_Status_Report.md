- **Patterns:** Service mocking, database integration, error simulation
- **Test Files:** 
  - `tests/services/` - Service layer testing
  - `tests/api/` - API endpoint testing
  - `tests/integration/` - Cross-service integration

### Frontend Testing Infrastructure
- **Framework:** Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Environment:** JSDOM with React rendering
- **Patterns:** Component testing, user interaction, state management
- **Test Files:**
  - `client/src/test/components/` - Component testing
  - `client/src/test/setup.tsx` - Test configuration

### E2E Testing Infrastructure
- **Framework:** Playwright with cross-browser support
- **Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
