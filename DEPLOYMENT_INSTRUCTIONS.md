# Deployment Instructions - DM_CRM_PROD Repository

## Git Repository Setup Complete âœ…

The codebase has been prepared and committed for deployment to the new production repository:
**https://github.com/drozmdg/DM_CRM_PROD.git**

## Manual Push Required (Authentication)

Due to GitHub authentication requirements, you'll need to complete the push manually:

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# If you have GitHub CLI installed
gh auth login
git push prod main
```

### Option 2: Using Personal Access Token
```bash
# Set up authentication with your PAT
git remote set-url prod https://<YOUR_USERNAME>:<YOUR_PAT>@github.com/drozmdg/DM_CRM_PROD.git
git push prod main
```

### Option 3: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys)
```bash
git remote set-url prod git@github.com:drozmdg/DM_CRM_PROD.git
git push prod main
```

### Option 4: Manual Upload
If you encounter any issues with git push, you can:
1. Download the current project as a ZIP
2. Create a new repository on GitHub
3. Upload the files manually through the GitHub web interface
