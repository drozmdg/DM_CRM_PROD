## Disaster Recovery Readiness


⚠️  **DISASTER RECOVERY SYSTEM NEEDS ATTENTION**

Review failed tests and ensure:
1. Backup and restore procedures are reliable
2. Container recovery is functional
3. RTO/RPO targets are met
4. Data integrity is preserved
5. All disaster scenarios are tested

**Production Readiness**: CONDITIONAL


## Recommendations

1. ❌ Implement baseline monitoring
2. ❌ Validate recovery procedures
3. ✅ Container recovery is functional
4. ✅ RTO targets are met
5. ✅ RPO targets are met

## Next Steps

- Implement automated disaster recovery testing
- Set up monitoring and alerting for disaster scenarios
- Create disaster recovery runbooks
- Train operations team on recovery procedures
- Establish regular disaster recovery drills
