## Database Connection Configuration

### Application Configuration Update:
```javascript
// Update database configuration in application
const dbConfig = {
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 5432,
  database: 'sales_dashboard_dev',
  user: 'postgres',

```

## Verification Queries

### Verify Migrated Data:
```sql
-- Check customer data
SELECT name, phase, contract_start_date, contract_end_date FROM customers ORDER BY name;

-- Check contact relationships
SELECT c.name, c.type, c.title, cu.name as customer_name 
FROM contacts c 
LEFT JOIN customers cu ON c.customer_id = cu.id 
ORDER BY c.type, c.name;

-- Check process status
SELECT p.name, p.status, p.sdlc_stage, c.name as customer_name
FROM processes p 
JOIN customers c ON p.customer_id = c.id 
ORDER BY p.start_date;

-- Verify record counts
SELECT 'customers' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM customers
UNION ALL
SELECT 'contacts', COUNT(*) FROM contacts  
UNION ALL
SELECT 'processes', COUNT(*) FROM processes;
