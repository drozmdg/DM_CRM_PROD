## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- Supabase project (for database operations only - no auth needed)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DM_CRM.git
cd DM_CRM
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Create server environment file
# Edit server/.env with your Supabase database credentials
```

Required environment variables in `server/.env`:
```bash
# Supabase Configuration (Database and Authentication)
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-key

# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
```

4. Start the application:
```bash
# Start the development server (integrated frontend + backend)
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:
- Application: http://localhost:5000 (serves both frontend and API)
- API endpoints: http://localhost:5000/api/*
